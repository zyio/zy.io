# About

DevOps, cloud or platform engineering; whatever you call it, we've got proven a track record of designing, building and operating complex production systems at scale.


We've worked across sectors from public services to critical national infrastructure and regulated industries. Whether it's been architecting multi-year platforms as part of large teams, leading rapid discovery projects, or being the sole technical resource delivering under tight deadlines - we adapt to what the project needs.

From legacy modernisation to greenfield builds, container orchestration to getting ancient systems talking to modern APIs - we focus on getting systems that actually work in production, not just on paper.

An abridged list of clients and work carried out can be found [here](clients) and a full CV with names and references is available by request, feel free to [get in touch](mailto:sam@zy.io)
